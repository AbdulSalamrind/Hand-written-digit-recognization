This Hand Written Digit Recognition using Logistic Regression project demonstrates the implementation of a simple yet effective handwritten digit recognition system using Logistic Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the basics of image classification.

The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits (0-9) from input images. This type of application has various real-world applications, including optical character recognition (OCR) and digit classification in postal services.

Key Features
Logistic Regression: We employ Logistic Regression, a linear classification algorithm, as the foundation of our recognition system.

MNIST Dataset: The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, one of the most widely used datasets for handwritten digit recognition. It contains a large collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Preprocessing: We perform essential preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and feature extraction to prepare the data for training and testing.

Multi-class Classification: The model is designed to classify input images into one of the ten digit classes (0-9), making it a multi-class classification problem.

Accuracy Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
